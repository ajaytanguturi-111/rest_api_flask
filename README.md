# rest_api_flask
A REST API that manages user data

This app is a simple REST API built with Flask that allows you to manage user data using basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It's ideal for learning the fundamentals of RESTful API development in Python. GET all users or a specific user by ID, POST a new user, PUT to update an existing user, DELETE a user by ID.
